# SudokoSolver
this gist of this project is me just messing up with sudoko and needing a way to see the end result

# Basic 
this is entirely written in python

I commented in the code and that should be helpful, but one thing that I will fully explain is the board where we have Array where we have 0-9, which zero represents blank space and 1-9, represents the number given to you when you first start the sudoko problem.
